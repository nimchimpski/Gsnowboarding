\f0\fs30 \cf0 This is the context for our discussion:\
I have a working strapi cms app running locally in development mode , on a mac. It is strapi version 4.7.1..\
The frontend is also hosted localy and consumes the local strapi API data without problem.\
Desired Goal:  Deploy the  Strapi CMS app in production mode onto a  VPS which has  a new version of ubuntu already installed. Use mysql database. First only deploy the strapi app. Dont use git. Use Rsync. Only when that is working, install nginx and  transfer the front end html files, and then  configure the front end to consume the data from the strapi API. The  VPS  IPv4 is 217.174.244.37.\
\
Use default values where possible, keep security to a minimum acceptable level. Keep it simple.\
\
First give an outline of the main steps, to be checked.\
\
When I say  proceed, just provide details of one step at a time, waiting for me to confirm that each step was successful by saying proceed.}
